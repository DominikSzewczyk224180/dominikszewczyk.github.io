# About Me

I’m a 3rd-year Data Science and AI student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, with a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. My journey has led me to collaborate with companies like Banijay on innovative AI projects, work with the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center (NPEC) to push the boundaries of plant science, and contribute to the Breda Municipality’s efforts to enhance city security through data-driven insights. Currently, I’m working on a cutting-edge project for Antea Group, which continues to challenge and excite me.

At 20 years old, I am fluent in Polish and English, with a basic understanding of German. Technology is at the heart of everything I do, and I am constantly exploring new innovations that can drive success in the projects I undertake.

## Key Skills

### Computer Vision
I started working with computer vision in late 2022, building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow to recognize spider species from images. Using GradCAM, I developed a prototype app that could classify spider danger levels. My work with the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center (NPEC) involved designing a pipeline that identifies plant roots, eliminating false positives, measuring root lengths, and marking key points. This project significantly boosted my skills with OpenCV and deepened my understanding of segmentation and image processing for scientific applications.

### Machine Learning
My journey into machine learning began with Banijay, where I analyzed large datasets to investigate the link between television ratings and viewership trends. This early exposure to data cleaning and model training led to the discovery of key strategies for improving audience engagement. In 2023, I developed a CNN for spider recognition and worked on a machine learning model for the Breda municipality that predicted monthly crime rates in neighborhoods. I presented the results in an interactive dashboard to support security planning. At Banijay, I also created an emotion classification pipeline using NLP, testing models such as BERT, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. One of my favorite projects involved NPEC, where I implemented a U-Net model to accurately detect plant roots, achieving root length measurements within a 12.392% sMAPE error margin. I also applied reinforcement learning to train a robot capable of pinpointing root endpoints and performing inoculation tasks.

### MLOps & Cloud Integration
Recently, I have mastered the intricacies of MLOps, particularly within cloud environments like Azure. My role in deploying scalable AI models for plant phenotyping involved building automated pipelines, integrating FastAPI, and using Docker for containerization, ensuring robust cloud-based solutions. My knowledge extends to continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for machine learning projects, which guarantees production-ready models.

### Data Analysis & Engineering
Data analysis has been at the core of all my projects. I’ve honed my skills in Python, leveraging tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze datasets and extract meaningful insights. I’ve also used R for academic surveys and SQL for database querying. I’m well-versed in creating interactive dashboards, such as the Power BI dashboard that tracks country progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Following best practices in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I ensure my analyses are thorough, reliable, and easy to communicate through clear visualizations.

## Soft Skills

### Teamwork
I have thrived in Scrum environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality results. My ability to adapt quickly to changing project requirements, keep communication clear and focused, and work closely with others has made me a reliable team member who adds value in fast-paced settings.

### Fast Learning
Each new project pushes me to learn quickly and effectively. Whether it’s mastering new tools like FastAPI and Sphinx or picking up skills in robotics and reinforcement learning, my ability to absorb new knowledge has been essential to my success in data science and AI.

### Communication
Clear communication has been a vital asset in every project I’ve led or been a part of. I excel in breaking down complex concepts, sharing knowledge with teammates, and ensuring everyone is aligned on goals and deliverables. I believe strong communication is key to keeping projects on track.

### Leadership
My leadership abilities allow me to guide teams efficiently, setting clear objectives and offering support where needed. In recent projects, I’ve found that motivating the team and fostering a collaborative environment leads to stronger outcomes and more innovative solutions.
