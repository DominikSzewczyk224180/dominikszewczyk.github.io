This project aimed to leverage AI insights to enhance facility management (FM) studies at Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUAS), resulting in actionable recommendations and strategic directions.

**Project Duration:** September 2023 - November 2023

## 🚀 Project Overview

As part of a five-person team at BUAS, we explored the impact of AI on students, staff, and the organization. Our mixed-method study combined surveys and interviews to investigate attitudes towards AI within facility management (FM) studies. This effort resulted in a comprehensive research paper, policy advice, and an interactive dashboard presented at the AI at BUAS Conference, providing actionable insights and strategic guidance.

## ⚙️ Data Collection & Analysis

During the data collection phase, I was responsible for creating a comprehensive survey using Qualtrics and conducting in-depth 40-minute interviews with 4th-year students. This phase involved gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. I preprocessed the survey data using R scripting and performed detailed analyses to uncover valuable trends and patterns, providing a solid foundation for our research.

## 📈 Visualization & Presentation

Using R scripting, my team and I developed impactful visualizations, including dynamic charts and interactive dashboards, to effectively communicate our findings. I took the lead in developing an interactive Streamlit dashboard, which was prominently featured at the AI at BUAS Conference. This dashboard helped in visualizing complex data and presenting it in an engaging and accessible manner.

## 🔍 Stakeholder Collaboration

Our team maintained active engagement with FM stakeholders to ensure that our research aligned with industry needs. Regular meetings and feedback sessions fueled our progress and led to meaningful outcomes and actionable recommendations tailored to real-world requirements.

## 🌟 Impact & Personal Growth

The project provided valuable insights for enhancing FM studies at BUAS and contributed to my growth as an analytics translator. It expanded my expertise in data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and strategic problem-solving. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of research methods and data collection practices, while refining my skills in data analysis using R.
