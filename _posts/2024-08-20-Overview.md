I'm a 3rd-year Data Science and AI student at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with companies like Banijay on NPEC and institutions such as the Breda Municipality. Currently, I’m working on an exciting project for Antea Group. I’m ambitious and always focused on delivering successful and impactful results. Technology and new innovations are a big part of my life, and I’m always eager to explore what’s next.
