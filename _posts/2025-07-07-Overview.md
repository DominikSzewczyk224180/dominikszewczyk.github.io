I'm a 3rd-year Data Science and AI student at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with companies like Banijay and institutions such as the Breda Municipality and NPEC. I recently worked on a project for Antea Group, exploring ways to enhance 3D building models. Currently, I’m gaining hands-on experience through my internship. I’m ambitious and always focused on delivering impactful results. Technology and innovation are a big part of my life, and I’m always eager to explore what’s next.
