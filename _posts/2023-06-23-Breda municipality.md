This project focused on improving the quality of life for Breda's residents, with an emphasis on safety through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

**Project Duration:** April 2023 - June 2023

## üéØ Project Overview

In this project, our team of five aimed to enhance the quality of life for Breda's residents, specifically focusing on safety. We created a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard to support city security efforts. The dashboard featured two primary components:
1. **Research on Safety in Breda:** Analysis of factors affecting safety across neighborhoods.
2. **Predictive Crime Model:** Forecasting crime rates to help with security measures.

## üîç Research & Analysis

Our approach began with a thorough investigation into the relationship between external factors and safety in Breda neighborhoods. We aimed to identify potential correlations and determine which factors significantly impacted safety dynamics. This analysis was crucial for understanding the key elements influencing neighborhood security.

## üìà Predictive Crime Model

We developed a machine-learning model to predict monthly crime rates across different neighborhoods. By leveraging historical data and relevant influencers, our model provided insights that were intended to aid in the formulation of effective security measures. This predictive capability was designed to offer valuable information for improving local safety.

## ü§ù Agile Scrum Teamwork

Throughout the project, we utilized the Agile Scrum methodology to foster efficient collaboration, shared responsibilities, and cohesive teamwork. The Scrum approach facilitated our efforts in managing tasks, addressing challenges, and achieving our project goals collaboratively. This experience enhanced our skills in teamwork and project management.

## üåê Real-World Impact

Our data-driven research, coupled with predictive modeling and interactive visualizations, delivered actionable insights for local authorities. These insights aimed to support efforts in enhancing neighborhood safety and improving the overall quality of life for Breda's residents.

## üå± Professional Skill Development

This project not only enriched our technical knowledge but also emphasized the importance of effective teamwork, task allocation, and shared responsibility. The Scrum framework played a pivotal role in guiding us toward efficient project management and successful project execution.
