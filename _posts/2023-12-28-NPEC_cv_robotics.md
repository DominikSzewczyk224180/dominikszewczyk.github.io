This project aimed to revolutionize plant analysis through the integration of computer vision and robotics, collaborating with the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center (NPEC) to enhance plant phenotyping and automation processes.

**Project Duration:** November 2023 - February 2024

## üí° Project Summary

Collaborating with NPEC, my focus was on advancing plant root segmentation from images and developing a robotic system for precise liquid handling. The goal was to improve plant phenotyping and automate processes, leveraging AI technologies to achieve greater precision and efficiency.

## üëÅ‚Äçüó® Computer Vision

Computer vision was central to this project. I applied various CV techniques to isolate the Petri dish and perform semantic segmentation on plant images. After obtaining clean data, I developed a machine learning model to predict masks for seeds, shoots, and roots. Instance segmentation allowed for the identification of individual plants, which was essential for accurate root length measurements and precise root tip localization. This capability was a significant step towards furthering the project's objectives.

## ü§ñ Robotics

In the robotics component, I simulated the development of a precision liquid handling robot. Using a PID controller, I programmed the robot to dispense liquids accurately. The integration of computer vision with robotics enabled precise liquid delivery to targeted root tips. This synergy demonstrated the effective combination of vision-based analysis with robotic automation, enhancing the precision of plant inoculation processes.

## üöÄ Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) was utilized to optimize the robot‚Äôs performance. I crafted reward functions and conducted hyperparameter analysis to fine-tune the RL model. With tools like ClearML, I ensured accurate evaluation of the robot's autonomous navigation and liquid delivery capabilities. This integration of RL with vision-based analysis showcased the potential for advanced automation in plant analysis.

## üìä Technical Report

The project culminated in a detailed technical report, which covered all aspects of the work, including dataset acquisition, preprocessing, and the intricacies of both the computer vision and robotics pipeline. The report featured a comprehensive flowchart and performance metrics, providing a thorough overview of the project‚Äôs scope, methodologies, and outcomes.
